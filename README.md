# Water Rocket Simulation

![Software GUI](/assets/example.png)
This software was originally made in Mathematica for the 2024 edition of the Brazilian Physicists' 
Tournament (BPT) to simulate the "Pet Bottle Rocket" problem. The original software can be found 
under the "refs" directory. 

To build this code, I based myself on an article by Dean Wheeler called "Modeling the Thrust Phase". 
He derived all the equations and physics behind the code.

In 2025, the Institute of Physics of the University of SÃ£o Paulo (IFUSP) promoted a winter school 
for high school students, and one of the activities was deeply related to the problem, so I decided
to create an application that allows students to simulate a water rocket with an interactive 
interface.

If you search online, you will find numerous water rocket simulations, but this was my attempt at it.
