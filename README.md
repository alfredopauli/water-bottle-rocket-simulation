# Water Rocket Simulation
This software was originally made in Mathematica for the 2024 edition of the Brazilian Physicists' 
Tournament (BPT) to simulate the "Pet Bottle Rocket" problem. The original software can be found 
under the "deps" directory.

In 2025, the Institute of Physics of the University of SÃ£o Paulo (IFUSP) promoted a winter school 
for high school students, and one of the activities was deeply related to the problem, so I decided
to create this application that allows students to simulate a water rocket with an interactive 
interface

If you search online, you will find numerous water rocket simulations, but this was my attempt at it.
